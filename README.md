# Meditation Link

This Meditation Link invites participants to close their eyes and meditate. This object, equipped with a camera, analyses the participants to detect their level of meditation and communicates from one object to another, inviting others to join a collective meditation. The object is open-source and designed to be built and deconstructed, learned and re-appropriated.

What can technology teach us? What is the scope of objects connected to the Internet? How can they be introduced to the new generations? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such objects? These are the kinds of questions that the European project Internet of Tricks has asked us to consider. We are developing educational kits through which we will run workshops about the place of technology and connected objects in our society.

What is the place of technology in our contemporary lives and what do we want to do with it?
